# HairDue

Will be an open-source appointment and payment management system for independent stylists.

I'm on the fringe of the black female hair space, but a big issue I hear often is surrounding payments and disputes regarding refunds for timing and fees.

My goal is to have one system where appointments and payments can be made, and funds can be held until all parties are in agreement on services rendered.
